Sales Analysis

**Introduction**

The Sales Analysis is an interactive dashboard created using Streamlit and Plotly to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail sales data. Users can upload datasets and explore sales trends, category performance, and regional distribution through dynamic visualizations.

With features like interactive filters, time-series analysis, and hierarchical treemaps, users can gain deeper insights into their business data. The dashboard supports filtering by Region, State, and City, allowing for precise data exploration. Additionally, it enables users to analyze sales vs. profit relationships and track seasonal trends over time.

A default dataset is available for demonstration, ensuring ease of use. The tool also offers downloadable processed data, making it convenient for further reporting and analysis. Designed for efficiency and ease of use, this dashboard transforms complex data into actionable insights, making retail analysis more accessible and engaging.

**Workflow**

Step 1: Upload Your Dataset

The app allows users to upload CSV, TXT, XLSX, or XLS files.

If no file is uploaded, a default sample dataset is loaded automatically.

Step 2: Data Processing & Cleaning

The uploaded file is read into a Pandas DataFrame.

The Order Date column is converted into a datetime format.

The system identifies the minimum and maximum dates for filtering.

Step 3: Applying Filters

Users can dynamically filter data by Region, State, and City to narrow down insights.

Date range selectors allow for time-based analysis, making it easy to explore seasonal trends.

Step 4: Data Visualization

Category-wise Sales: A bar chart illustrates sales across different product categories.

Regional Sales: A pie chart displays sales distribution across various regions.

Time Series Analysis: A line chart presents sales trends over months.

Hierarchical TreeMap: A layered visualization to analyze relationships between categories and subcategories.

Sales vs. Profit Scatter Plot: Highlights correlations between revenue and profitability.

Segment & Category Sales: Pie charts for additional breakdowns.

Summary Table: Provides an overview of key sales and profit metrics.

Step 5: Data Download & Export

Users can download processed datasets for further offline analysis.

The system provides multiple dataset formats for customized reporting.

What Makes This Project Unique?

Live Data Filtering & Insights: Instantly apply filters and watch data visualizations update in real time.

Comprehensive Time-Series Analysis: Users can track business performance over various time periods.

Interactive Treemap Visualization: Explore how sales and profit vary across regions, categories, and subcategories in a hierarchical view.

User-Friendly Interface: The dashboard is intuitive, requiring minimal technical expertise to operate.

Custom Export Feature: Download specific data segments for further analysis in external tools.
